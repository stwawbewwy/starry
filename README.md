<h1 align='center'>Cafe de Starry</h1>

A mysterious cafe that appears only on starry nights. When you smell the sweet scent, take a sip and have a deep dream. In a world of countless twinkling stars, sip a cup of fantasy-colored tea.

Welcome to Cafe de Starry.

## Hello! :sparkles:
If you couldn't tell already, the short paragraph is most certainly a reference to something. 

As Cafe de Starry remains as one of my personal favourite from TUMENECO, what better way to appreciate it further by making a rice that's a direct reference to it!
